  "description": "A segmented cascade design that stacks a high-temperature SiGe stage above a mid-temperature PbTe stage, harvesting useful work from a wider band of the thermal gradient. The stepped couple geometry was originally ground-validated for deep-space planetary power studies. At this scale the radiator and structural mass remain challenging, but the conversion gain over single-material designs is decisive.",
