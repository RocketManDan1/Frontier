  "description": "Evolved from the US SP-100 space reactor power programme, this unit scales silicon-germanium thermoelectric technology to multi-hundred megawatt thermal inputs. Improved couple geometry and a segmented hot-shoe design push efficiency well above first-generation hardware. Still demands careful radiator allocation, but the electric yield makes it viable for mid-range ship power budgets.",
