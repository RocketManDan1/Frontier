  "description": "A first-generation solid-state thermoelectric based on the US SNAP program's silicon-germanium couple heritage. No moving parts, no working fluid — just a thermal gradient driving current across SiGe junctions. Modest efficiency and high waste-heat load make radiator sizing the dominant challenge, but the simplicity is unmatched for early deployments.",
