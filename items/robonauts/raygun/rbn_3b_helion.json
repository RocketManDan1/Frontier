  "description": "The Helion fields the most capable remote sensing suite available at tier 3: a pair of instruments working in concert. The primary arm is a coherent X-ray laser (XFEL) fed by a superconducting linear accelerator, producing angstrom-wavelength photons that can penetrate several metres of regolith and diffract off crystal lattices — delivering high-resolution mineral phase maps without surface contact. The secondary arm is a pulsed neutron source (14 MeV deuterium-tritium generator) whose activation gamma-ray signatures identify bulk major-element chemistry including Fe, Si, Mg, O, H, Ca, Al, and Ti to depths of up to 3 m. Together, these instruments generate a 3D subsurface compositional model at up to 1,500,000 km standoff — enabling a ship transiting the inner Earth-Moon extended neighbourhood to catalogue entire clusters of near-Earth asteroids and Lunar Trojan candidates without deviation from its transfer trajectory. Surface-deployment mode routes 80 MW into sustained beam heating that melts and electrolyses ice at 22 t/hr, enough to fuel a continuous propellant production pipeline. Named for the ancient Greek personification of the Sun — an entity defined by relentless, penetrating radiance.",
