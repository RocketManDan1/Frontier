  "description": "The earliest raygun robonaut in the Earthmoon inventory, the Argus takes its name from the all-seeing hundred-eyed giant of Greek myth. A phased-array millimeter-wave radar operating in the 77–110 GHz band probes surface and shallow sub-surface structure at standoff distances up to 8,000 km — sufficient for characterising crater floor and polar pit composition from high lunar orbit. At that altitude the beam footprint covers multi-kilometre patches per dwell, enabling a single pass to map a candidate mining site without requiring low-orbit insertion. A co-boresighted 500 W continuous-wave CO₂ laser provides rudimentary thermal ablation for surface-prep before sample capture, and can melt a modest stream of exposed water ice when the unit is surface-deployed. Power draw reflects the radar's peak-pulse energy budget and the laser's continuous duty cycle. Simple to fabricate and maintain, the Argus is the standard survey tool for first-generation cis-lunar operations.",
