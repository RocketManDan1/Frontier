  "description": "A landmark advance in remote prospecting, the Solaris houses a compact free-electron laser (FEL) whose undulator assembly is tunable from deep UV (200 nm) to mid-IR (15 μm) without optic changes. This unprecedented spectral agility lets surveying algorithms select the exact wavelength best suited to each target mineral signature in real time. A secondary gamma-ray backscatter subsystem — driven by the same electron accelerator — detects hydrogen and carbon down to 2 m depth, enabling unambiguous identification of buried ice and carbonaceous material. At 500,000 km standoff the Solaris can scan any body within 1.3 times the Earth-Moon distance in a single pointing, allowing a ship at the Earth-Moon L4 or L5 Lagrange points to prospect the entire lunar surface and nearby near-Earth asteroid clusters during a single station-keeping hold. When deployed on the surface, 35 MW drives the FEL beam to industrial ice-melt rates sufficient to feed a medium-scale propellant depot. Named for the living ocean of sunlight described in Stanisław Lem's 1961 novel — a system that reasons about worlds by bathing them in directed energy.",
