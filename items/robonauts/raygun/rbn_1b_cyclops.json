  "description": "An augmented tier-1 raygun robonaut that boresights a pulsed 2 μm neodymium fiber laser onto the same aperture as its millimeter-wave radar. The laser delivers short (10 ns) high-peak-power bursts for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), enabling elemental composition readback at 25,000 km standoff — well outside the lunar sphere of influence, allowing a transfer-trajectory vessel to characterise landing sites before committing to orbital insertion. The extended range makes rapid successive scanning of multiple candidate sites along a single approach arc practical for the first time. When surface-deployed, the continuous-wave mode raises melt throughput to a quarter-tonne of water ice per hour, enough to bootstrap early propellant storage at a polar cache site. The additional mass relative to the Argus reflects enlarged optics, a secondary beam-shaping mirror assembly, and a more capable power-conditioning unit. Named for the single-eyed Cyclops of Greek legend, a nod to its high-power mono-aperture optical design.",
