  "description": "The Meridian is the first second-generation raygun robonaut to enter service, fielding a UV/Vis/NIR hyperspectral scanner across a 350–2500 nm bandpass alongside a 2 kW continuous-wave ytterbium fiber laser. Hyperspectral radiance cubes are processed on-board by a dedicated FPGA pipeline to identify mineralogic absorption features characteristic of hydrated silicates, carbonates, sulfates, and iron oxides — providing significantly more actionable prospecting data than the first-generation radar units. Standoff range reaches 80,000 km, placing the entire lunar sphere of influence within a single dwell from a cislunar waypoint; a ship holding position near the Earth-Moon L1 can scan any point on the near-side lunar surface without repositioning. The CW laser output enables useful ice melting when deployed: nearly a tonne per hour under sustained operation. The name Meridian refers to the sun crossing the sky's peak — an apt metaphor for a machine that reads sunlit surface spectra with precision.",
