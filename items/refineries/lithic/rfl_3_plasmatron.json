  "description": "The Plasmatron replaces resistive and sol-gel processing with a plasma torch as the primary energy delivery mechanism — a design philosophy proven in plasma-spray thermal barrier coatings for gas turbines (Pratt & Whitney, GE Aviation) and later adapted for rapid sintering of complex oxides. An RF-coupled inductive plasma torch operating at 5,000–15,000 K instantaneously dissociates silicate feedstock to atomic species, which then recombine in a controlled quench zone into precisely engineered nanocrystalline phases impossible to achieve with conventional thermal ramps. The four parallel processing chambers are fed by a single plasma generator through a gas-distribution manifold, and each chamber can run a different recipe simultaneously, giving the four-slot concurrent-recipe capability. The 20% efficiency improvement over the Calciner comes from the plasma torch's ability to process stoichiometrically perfect feedstock mixtures with near-zero phase contamination, reducing waste and rework. Coupled with plasma-enhanced CVD coating modules, the Plasmatron can deposit conformal ceramic films onto substrates — a capability required for next-generation photovoltaic and sensor components.",
