  "description": "The Sagger takes its name from the refractory clay boxes — saggers — used for centuries in ceramics kilns to shield wares from direct flame and ash contamination. The unit is a continuous rotary kiln and spray-calcination chamber derived directly from industrial Portland-cement and alumina-calcination technology scaled for microgravity operation. Raw silicate rock and oxide feedstock enter through an airlock-fed hopper, tumble through a heated refractory tube at controlled residence times, and exit as a calcined powder ready for sintering or wet-chemical processing downstream. All bearings are magnetic, eliminating tribological failure in vacuum. The Sagger can produce basic ceramics (advanced_ceramics) and consolidate bulk regolith into megastructure-grade matrix (megastructure_mass) at tier-1 throughput. It is deliberately dumb: no plasma, no vapor-phase chemistry, no isotope handling. That simplicity makes it the standard first installation for any new settlement — something a two-person crew can commission in a day using tools from the landing kit.",
