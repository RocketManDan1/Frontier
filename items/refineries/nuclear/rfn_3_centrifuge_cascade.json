  "description": "The Centrifuge Cascade is modeled on the gaseous centrifuge enrichment technology commercialized by the URENCO consortium (UK-Netherlands-Germany) beginning in the 1970s and later independently developed by the US Enrichment Corporation (USEC) at Paducah and Portsmouth. Each centrifuge machine spins UF₆ gas at 50,000–70,000 RPM inside a corrosion-resistant carbon-fiber rotor, creating a centrifugal gradient 1,000,000 times Earth gravity at the rotor wall — strong enough to separate isotopes by mass difference. Individual machines provide only a small separation factor (~1.3), but cascading hundreds or thousands in series and parallel multiplies the effect to produce weapons-grade or power-reactor-grade output from natural uranium feed. The facility contains 128 centrifuge machines arranged in four independently operable cascades of 32, with a fifth and sixth cascade dedicated to exotic isotope separation (Li-6, He-3, specific rare-earth isotopes) for fusion fuel and superconductor feedstock. The 20% efficiency advantage over the Thermal Diffuser arises partly from the higher intrinsic separation factor and partly from the ability to route exotic-isotope streams through the dedicated separations cascades rather than accepting full feedstock loss. At full utilization the four main cascades run simultaneously, enabling the four-slot concurrent-recipe capability.",
