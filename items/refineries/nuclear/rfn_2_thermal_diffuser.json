  "description": "The Thermal Diffuser is a direct descendant of the S-50 liquid thermal diffusion plant built at Oak Ridge in 1944-45 as part of the Manhattan Project — the first large-scale isotope separation process to operate, pre-dating the calutrons and gaseous diffusion plants that ultimately won the war. The operating principle exploits the Soret effect: in a fluid with a temperature gradient, heavier isotopes migrate toward the cooler wall while lighter isotopes migrate toward the hot wall, producing a slow but continuous partial separation. The unit converts radioactive ore feedstock to uranium hexafluoride (UF₆) by fluorination in a sealed chamber, then passes the gas through an array of twelve concentric-tube thermal diffusion columns — each an inner heated pipe and an outer cooled wall — where partial enrichment accumulates over multiple passes through a cascade configuration. This process requires large amounts of heat exchange power and is inherently inefficient (the S-50 consumed more electricity than the entire city of Knoxville for a relatively small isotopic gain), but requires no spinning machinery and has no vibration-sensitive components — making it more suitable for microgravity deployment than centrifuges. The output feeds directly into the Pelletiser's sintering stage to produce low-grade reactor pellets at higher-than-natural fissile content.",
