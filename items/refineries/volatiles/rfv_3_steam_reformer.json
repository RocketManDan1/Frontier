  "description": "The Steam Reformer is a multi-reaction chemical plant that runs three catalytic processes in parallel across its four chambers: steam methane reforming (SMR), the Sabatier reaction (CO₂ + 4H₂ → CH₄ + 2H₂O), and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis of higher hydrocarbons from syngas. SMR is the backbone of industrial hydrogen production on Earth (97% of all H₂ is made this way); the Sabatier is the CO₂ conversion process used on the ISS to recycle carbon dioxide back into methane propellant. FT synthesis — the same chemistry that powered Germany's World War II synthetic fuel program and South Africa's Sasol plants through apartheid-era oil embargoes — produces long-chain hydrocarbons from the CO + H₂ syngas mixture, yielding high-energy propellant feedstocks (high_energy_propellant_feedstock) and the precursor organics for cryo-polymers and biosphere materials. The four chambers give the flexibility to balance the process mix in response to feedstock availability and demand. The 20% material efficiency advantage comes from tight heat integration: the exothermic FT reaction provides thermal energy to the endothermic SMR reaction through a counter-flow heat exchanger, cutting the external electric heating demand significantly.",
