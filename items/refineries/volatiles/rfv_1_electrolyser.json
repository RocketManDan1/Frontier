  "description": "The Electrolyser is the simplest and most essential chemical processing unit in the volatiles branch: a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser stack derived directly from industrial water-splitting technology deployed today by ITM Power, Nel ASA, and Siemens Energy for green hydrogen production. Water ice feedstock is melted by waste heat from the power bus, de-ionized through a resin-bed demineralizer to protect the membrane, and split at the cell stack into hydrogen and oxygen streams by DC current. The two product gases are compressed by oil-free diaphragm compressors, stored in composite overwrap pressure vessels (COPV), and further cooled by Joule-Thomson expansion to produce liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid hydrogen (LH₂) for propellant storage. At tier-1, the unit is a single-stack design with no redundancy — any membrane cell failure requires a stack swap from the spares locker. Despite its simplicity, the Electrolyser underpins every subsequent volatiles operation: the hydrogen it produces feeds the Sabatier and Fischer-Tropsch reactions at higher tiers, and the oxygen byproduct drives life support and combustion wherever needed. Power draw is dominated by the electrolysis stack; the compression and liquefaction systems draw the remainder.",
