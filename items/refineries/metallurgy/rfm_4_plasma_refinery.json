  "description": "The Plasma Refinery is the engineering pinnacle of metallurgy: a facility in which atmospheric plasma arcs at 8,000–20,000 K serve simultaneously as the energy source, refining medium, and deposition instrument. The design descends from the transferred-arc plasma furnaces used in ferro-alloy production (Hatch, SMS group) and from the plasma spray forming research at Sandia National Laboratories, but operates at a scale and sophistication orders of magnitude beyond its precursors. The six processing chambers span the full metallurgical spectrum: two are plasma arc skull furnaces for ultra-clean remelting of complex multi-element alloys, two run plasma spray deposition to build near-net-shape structural components directly from feedstock powder, and two contain Bridgman directional solidification crucibles for single-crystal and oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) alloy growth. The 32% feedstock efficiency advantage over base tier comes from full composition closure: the closed-cycle plasma produces no dross or slag, lost metal is recaptured from chamber walls as condensate and re-fed, and the near-net-shape spray forming chambers eliminate the machining waste inherent in cast-and-wrought approaches. Running at full throughput across all six chambers, the Plasma Refinery can supply the structural metal needs of a small orbital colony from asteroid-derived ore alone.",
