  "description": "The Talpa — Latin for mole, and namesake of DLR's HP³ penetrating heat probe carried to Mars by InSight — represents the second tier-1 gravity constructor variant, augmenting the Antaeus's bucket-drum system with a resonant percussive drill module and an inline microwave sintering nozzle. The drill module uses a self-hammering mechanism derived from the Ultrasonic/Sonic Driller/Corer (USDC) technology developed at JPL: a piezoelectric stack drives a free-floating hammering mass at tens of kilohertz, disaggregating compacted regolith and fractured rock at a fraction of the static preload force required by conventional rotary drill bits — a decisive advantage in low-gravity environments where any drill tends to push the vehicle away rather than down. Excavated material feeds the bucket conveyor and into a holding bin. The microwave sintering nozzle, inspired by NASA MSFC's experiments in in-situ regolith consolidation, sweeps the work surface at 2.45 GHz and fuses regolith grains in place to form a consolidated bearing surface or low-form wall without added binder. The combination raises mining throughput to 75 kg/hr and construction rate to 28 kg/hr, while the sinter capability unlocks foundation preparation that the pure-mechanical Antaeus cannot perform.",
