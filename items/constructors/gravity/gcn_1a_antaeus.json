  "description": "The baseline gravity constructor, the Antaeus takes its name from the Greek giant who was invincible so long as his feet touched the Earth — an apt symbol for a machine that derives all its capability from direct contact with the ground. Mechanically, the Antaeus is a direct descendant of NASA's RASSOR (Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot) concept: counter-rotating bucket drums mounted at each end of a central chassis cancel their excavation reaction forces against one another, allowing effective regolith collection in lunar gravity (1.62 m/s²) without the anchor mass that hampers single-drum designs. The chassis is driven by six independently articulated wheel-legs derived from JPL ATHLETE heritage, giving the unit the ability to step over boulders up to 1 m in height and self-right after a tip-over. The construction arm is a 3-DOF cable-drive manipulator capable of placing pre-fabricated structural panels, driving expansion bolts into regolith-sintered foundations, and dispensing a basic thermal-spray binder to join loose rubble walls. At 50 kg/hr mining throughput and 18 kg/hr construction rate, the Antaeus is slow by later standards but has no single-point failure modes and can be maintained with tools carried aboard any landing craft.",
