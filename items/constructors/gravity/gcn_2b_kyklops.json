  "description": "The Kyklops — named for the one-eyed giants of Greek myth who served as Hephaestus's forge workers, crafting thunderbolts and tridents in the volcanic caverns beneath Etna — extends the Hephaestus platform with a co-mounted continuous-wave fiber laser prespallation system. Laser-assisted mechanical excavation works by directing a 4 kW near-infrared beam ahead of the vibro-drum teeth, locally heating exposed regolith or rock to 600–900°C before mechanical contact. Thermal spalling induced by rapid surface heating reduces the specific excavation energy of silicate material by a further 40–50 percent beyond vibro-agitation alone, enabling the Kyklops to work through intact basalt strata and ilmenite layers that resist even resonance-assisted cutting. The construction module adds a directed-energy deposition (DED) fabrication arm delivering a regulated regolith melt stream cast into mold forms: the laser raises a confined pool of regolith to full melt in under a minute, and a shaped nozzle pours the melt into pre-positioned forms to yield cast basalt structural panels with compressive strengths up to 120 MPa — comparable to structural concrete. At 225 kg/hr mining and 82 kg/hr construction, the Kyklops substantially outperforms the Hephaestus while fitting within the same logistics footprint as a single standard container.",
