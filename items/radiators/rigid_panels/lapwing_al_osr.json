  "description": "Fixed aluminum honeycomb panels bonded with optical solar reflector (OSR) second-surface mirrors — the same approach used on early planetary spacecraft and the SNAP reactor test articles. Lightweight and manufacturable, but the 800 K operating limit and large panel footprint make it a transitional solution. Best suited to low-power ships where waste-heat loads are modest.",
