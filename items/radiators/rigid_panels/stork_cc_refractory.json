  "description": "Carbon-carbon composite structural panels with a refractory oxide surface treatment — a materials combination developed for high-enthalpy atmospheric re-entry structures and adapted here for sustained high-temperature space radiation service. At 1100 K the specific rejection rate is ~73 kW/m², enabling the same mass of hardware to shed ten times more waste heat than first-generation aluminum panels. Required for vessels running segmented cascade or SP-100 class thermoelectric generators.",
