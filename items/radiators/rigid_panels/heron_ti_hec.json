  "description": "Titanium-alloy substrate panels coated with a plasma-sprayed high-emissivity ceramic. The higher operating temperature compared to aluminum OSR panels dramatically improves specific rejection per unit area (Stefan-Boltzmann scales as T^4), allowing meaningful heat loads from early thermoelectric generators to be managed without crippling panel mass. The ceramic coating is stable to 1050 K with adequate design margin.",
